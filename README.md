# :information_source: Patch 92 support

* Unofficial version of the TERA Toolbox for patch 92 with auto-updates of all supported modules. You can get some modules available on the `Get More Mods` tab.

## Warranty

* The original maintainer of this software is still a [SaltyMonkey](https://github.com/SaltyMonkey). In this fork, we just added support for patch 92 for convenient installation of module updates corrected for this patch. We do not guarantee the full functionality of this version and the modules installed in it.

# TERA Toolbox
* Next generation of Tera-Proxy: Automatic updates, a graphical user interface, automated client mods, a direct connection to the game client (allowing e.g. realtime datacenter queries), and a lot more!
* Please check out [the documentation](doc/main.md) (especially if you want to develop your own modules)!
* Originally forked from https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox (latest patch 115).

# Installation Instructions
* Download the archive from [GitHub](https://github.com/tera-private-toolbox/tera-toolbox/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip it to any installation folder.
* Run the `TeraToolbox.exe` in the installation folder if you want to use toolbox with a graphical user interface (GUI; highly recommended!), or `TeraToolboxCLI.exe` in the installation folder for a command line interface (CLI).
* The first startup after installing TERA Toolbox may take a while, depending on your internet connection. This is because all required files will be downloaded and updated automatically.
* The most popular mods are already pre-installed for your convenience - check out the `My Mods` page. If you don't want to use a particular module, just uninstall or disable it there.
* Check out the `Get More Mods` page for mods you want to install, and the `Settings` page to configure TERA Toolbox according to your needs.
* Once you're all set, press the `Start!` button in the top right corner, then start the game as usual.
